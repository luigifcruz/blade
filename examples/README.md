# Examples
These are very simple examples of how to use the library modules to create a custom pipeline for your data.

## Pipeline C++
This example shows how to create an asynchronous pipeline in C++. The pipeline is composed of three modules. With the first and last ones being cast modules. These will be used to convert the input and output data to the desired type. The Gather module is in the middle and will be used to tile the input data of one axis. For example, the input data of shape (1, 1, 2, 1) will be tiled to (1, 1, 8, 1).

## Pipeline Python
This example shows how to create an synchronous and asynchronous version of a pipeline using Python bindings. This pipeline is a very simple Polarizer module that will take the horizontal and vertical components of the input data and output the circularly polarized right and left components. However, the inner workings of the module are not important for this example. The main takeaway is how the user can create a pipeline and use it to process data with synchronous and asynchronous execution.
