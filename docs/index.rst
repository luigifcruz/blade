BLADE
=====

The Blade library provides accelerated signal processing modules for radio telescopes
like the Allen Telescope Array. The core library is written in modern C++20 and makes
use of just-in-time (JIT) compilation of CUDA kernels to deliver accelerated processing
with runtime customizability. Python bindings are also available.

Blade is organized in Modules, Pipelines, and Runners. A Module is a unit that does the
data manipulation, for example, a Cast module converts an array of elements from a type
to another (e.g. Integer to Float). A Pipeline is a collection of Modules working
together, for example, using a Cast module to convert each element type before
processing the data with a Channelizer module. A Runner is a helper class that will
create multiple instances of a Pipeline and executes them in parallel to take advantage
of all resources provided by the GPU.
